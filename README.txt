file name: five_cell_scenario
variable c in line 4 contains the number of cells
L in line 5 is the links per cell(L/2 is the user per cell)
M in line 6 is the number of tx and rx antenna under consideration
line 13 to 18 define the sample victim/interferer pair
variable "count" captures the number of packets dropped
variable "link_count_data" captures the successful packet transmitted across the links
variable "link_count_fail" captures the packets dropped across the links
variable "uldldata" captures the UL(0)/DL(1) slots scheduled across the cells for the slots simulated
run the file and you will get the plots mentioned in the report
